# About me
My name is **Quynh Thu**, but my friends like to call me *Tanya*. I was born on a cold winter night, on the **1st of february** in **1999** year in a small village in **Vietnam**. Actually, I do not remember much about my early childhood because of a car accident when I was 11. It wasn't a very serious accident, but it somehow damaged a part of my memory. But, anyway, my parents said that I was a very active and communicative child. One thing that I surely know about myself in early childhood is that **I love drawing**. I've always wanted to be an *artist* or a *fashion designer*. 

I'd lived in Vietnam till 3 years old and then my parents left me and my elder sister to my aunt and uncle. As my family was very poor and they had to leave us and move to Russia to make money. So, we lived without our parents till I turned 9. My parents decided that we should move to Russia with them.  And now, *we are living happy together in Moscow*. 
As I mentioned before, I love *drawing* and my dream was to become fashion designer. But, unfortunately, I couldn't enroll to the university that I wanted and the only thing I could do is to enroll to **HSE** as a linguist. Nevertheless, I’m not upset at all, I like it here, in **HSE**. Though, I’m not giving up on my dream because I will do it when I finish my bachelor degree. 

Beside drawings, I have a lot of different hobbies, such as:
+ Photography
+ Reading
+ Listening to music
+ Cooking

## My life goals are definitely: 
+ *Enroll to British Higher School of Art and Design*
+ *Travel a lot*
+ *Open a showroom with my own design clothes*
+ *Meet a lot of famous designer and models*
+ ***Become a successful person!***

By the way, I’ve painted a lot of *pictures* since 2015 and down below you can see some of paintings and photos that I took during travelling:
